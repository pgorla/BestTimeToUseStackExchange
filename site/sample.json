        "Body":" How do you express an integer as a binary number with Python literals?    I was easily able to find the answer for hex:          gt; gt; gt; 0x12AF     4783      gt; gt; gt; 0x100     256      and, octal:          gt; gt; gt; 01267     695      gt; gt; gt; 0100     64       How do you use literals to express binary in Python?            Summary of Answers        Python 2.5 and earlier: can express binary using  int('01010101111',2)  but not with a literal.   Python 2.5 and earlier: there is  no way  to express binary literals.   Python 2.6 beta: You can do like so:  0b1100111  or  0B1100111 .   Python 2.6 beta: will also allow  0o27  or  0O27  (second character is the letter O) to represent an octal.   Python 3.0 beta: Same as 2.6, but will no longer allow the older  027  syntax for octals.    ",
